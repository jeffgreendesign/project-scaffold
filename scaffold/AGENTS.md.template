# AGENTS.md

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: This file is for Codex/GPT-style agents. Keep it concise and executable. -->
<!-- Codex 5.3+ reads AGENTS.md automatically before starting work (32 KiB limit). -->
<!-- Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md instead. Maintain both files if your team uses both tools. -->
<!-- To make Codex also read CLAUDE.md, add it to project_doc_fallback_filenames in ~/.codex/config.toml -->

4. Update docs when behavior or interfaces change.
